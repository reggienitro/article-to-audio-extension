## What the Extension Does (Current State)

### ‚úÖ Working Features
- **UI Interface**: Complete popup with all controls
- **Settings Storage**: Remembers your voice/speed preferences  
- **Article Detection**: Analyzes page content
- **Right-click Menus**: Context menu integration
- **Progress Simulation**: Shows realistic conversion progress

### üîÑ Simulated Features (Not Yet Integrated)
- **Actual CLI Integration**: Currently simulated
- **Real Audio Generation**: Shows success but doesn't call CLI yet
- **File Storage**: Simulated file creation

## Next Steps After Testing

Once you've tested the extension interface:

1. **Report what works/doesn't work**
2. **Note any UI improvements needed**
3. **Test with different article types**
4. **We'll then integrate with the actual CLI**

The extension is fully functional as a UI - it just needs the backend integration to actually call the `article2audio-enhanced` CLI tool.

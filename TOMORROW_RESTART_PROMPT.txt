CONTINUATION PROMPT: Article-to-Audio Extension - Final Testing

Load my configuration from /Users/aettefagh/claude-config/CLAUDE.md. I have 12 MCP servers configured. Follow my development principles especially asking clarifying questions before building.

CONTINUE ARTICLE-TO-AUDIO PROJECT: We achieved 95% completion yesterday with Enhanced Personal Data Lake v2.0.2 successfully deployed. All technical components are working - the Chrome extension extracts content (13,221 chars), server converts to audio (2160+ words), API returns 200 status, and success detection is implemented.

CURRENT STATUS: Chrome extension shows "âœ… Conversion successful!" in console logs, but need to verify final user experience and audio playback.

PROJECT LOCATION: /Users/aettefagh/AI projects/claude-tools/article-to-audio-extension

IMMEDIATE TASK: Test Chrome extension end-to-end to verify success message displays correctly in popup (not just console) and check audio URL format. The extension should now show success instead of errors.

SERVER: https://article-to-audio-extension-1.onrender.com (Enhanced Personal Data Lake v2.0.2 operational)

DETAILED HANDOFF: Read SESSION_HANDOFF_2025-08-18_FINAL.md in project directory for complete technical details, debugging protocols, and testing procedures.

KEY ACHIEVEMENT: We successfully implemented nuclear deployment strategy with symlink compatibility fix, content extraction via script injection fallback, proper success detection logic, and base64 audio embedding for Render's ephemeral file system.

NEXT STEPS: 
1. Test Chrome extension (chrome://extensions/ â†’ reload â†’ test on article page)
2. Verify success message in popup 
3. Check audio URL format (should be base64 data URL)
4. If successful, project is COMPLETE! ðŸŽ‰

TESTING PROTOCOL: Load extension at chrome://extensions/, go to news article, click extension icon, click "Convert to Audio", expect success message instead of error.

Ready for final verification - the hard work is done!
